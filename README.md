## Data Structures in JavaScript ##

The purpose behind this project is to provide JavaScript implementations for various common data structures in computer science. In addition to providing implementation details, another goal is to provide enough documentation for students to learn and understand how these data structures work.

For now, the data structures included in this project are:
1. Linked List (singly)
2. Stack
3. Queue
4. Tree
5. Binary Search Tree
6. Graph
